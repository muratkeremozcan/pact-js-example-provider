 Note about PROVIDER STATES: we can simulate certain states of the API (like an empty or non-empty DB)
 in order to cover different scenarios
 The state could have many more variables; it is a good practice to represent it as an object
 Note that the consumer state name should match the provider side

 * The purpose of the stateHandlers is to ensure that the provider is in the correct state
 to fulfill the consumer's expectations as defined in the contract tests.
 * In a real-world scenario, you would typically set up this state by interacting with your service's database
 * or through an API provided by the service itself (locally).
 * This ensures that the provider test runs in a controlled environment where all the necessary data
 and conditions are met, allowing for accurate verification of the consumer's expectations.

Pact docs mention state setup and teardown
https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/javascript/docs/provider#provider-state-setup-and-teardown

but it doesn't work with TS at the moment
https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/issues/1164

StateHandlers can either use:

* a single function: this is only used for the setup phase, where you define a function that sets up the provider state. 
It cannot handle teardown.

* an object with separate setup and teardown properties: this allows you to specify distinct functions 
for both the setup and teardown phases. The setup function will initialize the required state, 
and the teardown function will clean up after the tests have run.

What is the distinction between setup & teardown vs beforeEach & afterEach in options?
TL, DR; granularity

afterEach in options runs after every single test
the teardown in stateHandlers runs only after the tests which use that specific state

beforeEach in options runs before every single test
the setup in stateHandlers runs only before the tests which use that specific state
